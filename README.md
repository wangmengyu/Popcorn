# To set up your own server:
**If you want to host PHP and MP4 Exploits:**

1. Download hosting files from https://gbatemp.net/threads/5-5-1-5-4-0-5-3-2-self-hosting-package-everything-in-one-zip-file.424679/
2. FTP hosting files to a website that supports PHP (ex. 000webhost.com)

**If you only want to host the MP4 Exploits (PHP doesn't work with this):**

1. Download hosting files from https://gbatemp.net/threads/5-5-1-5-4-0-5-3-2-self-hosting-package-everything-in-one-zip-file.424679/
2. Make a gh-pages branch https://pages.github.com/
